## Description

This project is an online book store with an admin zone that can be accessed through login. The admin zone, located at the URL "/admin," allows administrators to manage the store by adding, updating, and deleting products. The website also keeps track of payments made by customers and stores them in MYSQL DB. 
The stock of the Books is automatically updated when a payment is completed. If a book becomes unavailable, the payment is canceled, and an appropriate message is displayed.

The website utilizes session beans to implement the shopping cart functionality.
using the Spring MVS(Model View Controller) architecture,
